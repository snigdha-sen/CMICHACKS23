# CMICHACKS23

Code to fit diffusion MRI signal models using self-supervised learning, developed during the UCL CMIC Hackathon 2023.

# Aims of the Hackathon

1. Adapt existing ssVERDICT code base so that model isn't fixed
2. Write various diffusion MRI model compartments in differentiable form
3. Combine to form ball and stick, rVERDICT, brain VERDICT, NODDI, SANDI, etc - create examples of these
4. Test on simulated data
5. Trial on real prostate/brain data
